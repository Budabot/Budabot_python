# Tyrbot

This is a rewrite of the original [Budabot](https://github.com/Budabot/Budabot) in Python3.  

Budabot is an in-game chat-bot for the MMORPG Anarchy Online released by Funcom in 2001.  

## Installation
Tyrbot is now ready for general use and is recommended over Budabot or any other bot for all new installations.

To install dependencies: `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`.

If you have multiple versions of Python on your path, you may need to use `pip3`. 

## Start
To start the bot, run either `start.bat` or `start.sh`.

If it is your first time running the bot, or if the config.json file does not exist, it will take you through the configuration wizard to configure the bot. You will need to have a character name that you you want to run the bot as along with the username and password for the account that has that character. If you want to run this bot as an org bot, you will also need the EXACT org name of the org and the character that the bot runs as will need to already be a member of that org.
