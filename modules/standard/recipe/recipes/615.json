Trimming however does come at a price, by boosting one part of the bot's functions another is lowered. For example, if you use a Trimmer to raise the defense of your bot then the aggressiveness of it will be lowered. Trimmers can be purchased from general shops, but this specific Trimmer can only be built, and it has one advantage...it will increase the chances of your bot keeping aggro on whatever it's fighting, at no cost of other skills. This means an Engineer will be less likely of getting attacked leaving his/her bot to do all the fighting. The lowest version Aggression Trimmer you'll be able to assemble is QL 30, keep that in mind when buying parts. </font><font color=#009B00>\n\n#L \"Chemical Impact Injector\" \"142911\"\n<img src=rdb://130815>\n\n#L \"XU-11 Serum\" \"154909\"\n<img src=rdb://100338>\n\n#L \"Trimmer Casing\" \"154938\"\n<img src=rdb://154935>\n</font>\n<font color=#FFFF00> All of them can be found at general shops.

Also the Trimmer only works on robotic pets... not on Metaphysicist pets.\nA quality level 200 Trimmer requires 751 Mechanical Engineering and 551 Computer Literacy\n\nNote: Remember that as you upgrade your bot to a strong version, you should do the same with the Trimmer.\n\n* May also require a small amount of Computer Literacy (less than x1.6).  </font><font color=#009B00>"
