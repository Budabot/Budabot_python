Combine all ingredients except red onion and mix well.\n2. Place red onion on top and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2-3 hours before serving.\n3. Before serving, mix well and serve with lettuce, corn, avocado or other cold salad vegetables on the side.\n4. It is important to use a juicer that presses the juice out of the limes, not one that will tear the membrane of the lime sections since this will make the lime juice bitter.\n\n\n<yellow>Servings: 6</yellow>"
