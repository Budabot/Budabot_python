consider a replication strategy
include access_level in sender obj
Time command param to include both seconds and time_str
fix number grouping on linux
investigate async/await for events and commands
off/on relay commands between org and private channels
manually run timer events
add !logon/!logoff
add credits to !about
add a command to list all raid loot categories
add poh to raid loot lists
combine !is and !whois?
format !implant better
fix for "mult. melee"
